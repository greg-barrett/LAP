      <p>Tucked away in the rolling hills of the Dordogne, Les Arbres Paresseux is a home away from home, for those looking to relax and unwind.</p>
      <p>Over the last five years the house has been lovingly restored by its owners and now offers two bedroomed accomodation set in an idyllic garden.</p>
      <p>It is located near the small town of Brantome, less than an hour from Bordeaux Airport and only an eight hour drive from Calais.</p>
      <p>We invite you to explore <%= link_to "the house", house_path, class: "text-link" %> and its <%= link_to "location", location_path, class: "text-link" %>, or <%= link_to "reserve", calendar_path(Date.today), class: "text-link" %> your next stay.</p>
