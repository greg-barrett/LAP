      <p>Tucked away in the rolling hills of the Dorodgne, Les Abres Parreseux provides a home away from home, for those looking to relax and unwined.</p>

      <p>Located less than an hour from Bordeux Airport and only an eight hour drive from Calais the setting is perfect for touring the surrounding villages and countryside.</p>
      <p>We invite you to explore the house, its location and the story of its restoration further or book.</p>
